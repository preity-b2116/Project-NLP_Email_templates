Hello [Prospect name],
I know it's the busy holiday season, but I wanted to say ""hello"" and remind you why we're such a good match. Think of each point as a small gift to yourself this year:

[Insert prospect problem + how you can solve it] (i.e., Data entry is eating away at your time, but Company X can reduce entry time by X%.)
[Insert product, service or feature]: [Insert reason/way it benefits your prospect] (i.e., Multi-user upload function: Kiss the days of waiting for your 10 teammates to finish uploading before you have a chance. This feature offers a solution to one of your biggest pain points.)
[Insert budgetary fit + discount info for buying before end of year] (i.e., Our price + your budget = the perfect fit)

If you're ready to get that demo scheduled, grab some time on my calendar here: [Link to meetings tool]
Happy Holidays,

... they all went viral on social media!
Forgive the silly joke, but I knew cats would get your attention. I loved your recent piece about social media predictions for the coming year, and I wondered if you'd given any thought to predictions for where SEO is headed, too.
Here at SearchWorld, we predict that AMP and machine-learning will take center stage in Google's quest to make search easier and more intuitive for the searcher.
We put together a report about how SEO has evolved and other predictions for where we think it's headed next, and I think it would be a great reference if you decide to write a follow-up piece about the future of SEO. I've attached the report below -- take a look, and let me know if there are any changes you'd suggest!
Thanks in advance, Jack

Hey Sophia,
Thanks for writing such a thorough recap of Facebook's F8 conference. It was super helpful for those of us who couldn't attend in person or watch the live stream!
I thought you made an interesting point about the competition heating up between Facebook and Snap Inc., but I think you could be missing a bigger idea here. I think it's not as much a competition for users as it is a competition for features innovation vs. features execution.
I wrote up my take on the brands' competition on our blog today and cited your recap -- would you like to take a look? Maybe we could collaborate together on a blog post or video on how social media marketers should best evaluate the two companies' competing apps.
Thanks, Jack

Thanks for sending over the information on the additional content pieces you would like us to create prior to the launch of the new website. It’s a great idea, and I think they will add a lot of value to visitors who are unfamiliar with your brand and products.
I’ve gone ahead and updated the scope of work [Link or Attach] to include these two new content projects, which you will see reflected in the revised quote. The price for the additional content offers comes to [$X,000]. Take a look, and let me know if you have any questions. Once you approve, I’ll add those two projects to [Project Management Tool] where you’ll be able to review and track the timeline for completion and approvals.

Hi [First Name],
I hope you’re ready!
The team just finished up the design comps for the redesign of the homepage, and I'm so excited to show them off to you. I think you’ll find that while the two versions are very different, they both solve the problem of your visitors failing to understand how easy to implement your solution is.
But first, we want to highlight a few things from the approved creative brief to set the stage:

[Target audience]
[The problem the design should solve]
[The action viewers should take]
[The emotion/feeling people should have when viewing]

Now, here are the design mockups with an accompanying description of why we made certain decisions.

Version 1 [Link]
Version 2 [Link]

After viewing these, please let us know if you have any opinions on the following for each design:

What’s memorable?
Which do you think will appeal more to your target audience?
Is the messaging in line with the needs/challenges of your visitors?
Is the call to action compelling and clear? Could we do anything to improve this?
Which one do you think will perform better with your target visitors?

As we mentioned in our last meeting, we think it would be valuable to do a heat mapping test on these two version to determine which converts at a higher rate. Here’s a [Link] to the description of the project and price for that test.
If you’d like to have a call to discuss this, click here [Link to Online Booking Calendar] to schedule time on my calendar.

Hi [First Name],
I wanted to follow up with you to see if you have any feedback on the design comps I sent over late last week. Please let me know if you have any suggestions/questions or inform me of your approval of one of the designs.
To meet the requested launch day of [Date], we will need at least [# of Days or Weeks] for development and testing. If I don’t receive your approval by [Date], we’ll have to push back beginning on Phase II of the project, which will impact the final delivery date.
I’ll follow up by phone if I don’t hear from you by tomorrow morning.

Hi [First Name],
I’m checking in with some news on the project. Everything looks really good right now, as you saw during our check-in last week, but we actually encountered a problem that will impact the original launch date. We’re not going to be able to meet the original due date because of [List Reasons]. While this is something we discussed was a risk factor that could impact the launch date during the project scoping, we were hoping it could be avoided. We’re doing everything we can to minimize the impact, including [State Actions Taken].
Based on the timeline of the vendor, I’ve adjusted the milestones, including your review and approval dates, in [Project Management Tool]. The new final delivery date is set for [Date].
I apologize for any negative consequences this may have on your schedule. I’d be happy to discuss how we can help to reduce the impact of any issues due to the change.
Please give me a call to discuss this further if you’d like, or you can schedule a time with me here [Link to Online Booking Calendar].

Hi Tim,
Great Twitter question about finding freelancers. Many of the startups I work with hire college students to freelance for them — the students get experience, and the companies get good content at an affordable rate.
Here are a couple other sites you might find useful:

Upwork (a freelance marketplace)
Inbound.org (an online community with many active freelancers)

Let me know if you’d like to discuss this or get a few more suggestions on a call.

Hi [Prospect],
I think there is an opportunity for us to help you run some amazing campaigns that can increase sales, generate buzz, and enhance brand awareness through our network's YouTube videos.
Our platform has completely revolutionized the way beauty, fashion, and lifestyle brands partner with YouTube Influencers by providing easy access to thousands of creators, by facilitating end-to-end conversations from campaign inception to completion, and by providing real time analytics across many more performance metrics than any other platform. Would love to tell you more about the ROI we are currently getting for our brand partners. You can also check out our media deck. 
If interested, I find it’s best to learn more about your needs over a quick call -- so let me know your upcoming availability.
Looking forward to connecting :)
Best,

Hi [Prospect],
A friend of mine just introduced me to [Brand]. He had such high praise that I immediately signed up for your [product] beta launch notification.
He also told me that I'd be impressed with your influencer marketing. He was right! Looks like you're getting some great traction with the [hashtag] Instagram posts and I really loved this YouTube video: [link]. Great choice to work with [YouTube creator] as they always seem to drive great results.
Are you seeing a measurably higher customer acquisition rate from these [hashtag] posts and YouTube videos compared to other marketing efforts?
Best,
[Rep]
"

Sorry. Somehow I missed this email. That's awesome that your friend recommended you and even better to hear that you're considering [product]. We would love to have you. I could actually give you a discount as well if you'd like :-)
Influencer marketing has been great for us. As a startup it's probably the most efficient way to help organically grow your base. That being said, it's a mixed bag when it comes to ROI based on conversions. Some bloggers/YouTubers etc. are awesome from a brand awareness standpoint but aren't as effective in conversions. We've had some big wins and others that are just okay. All in all, it works out, but it's sometimes tough to predict results. As as startup with limited resources, the hit or miss nature prevents us from doing a lot more of it.
"

Hi [Prospect],
I've been really impressed with your influencer marketing on Instagram and YouTube. I shared your YouTube video with my friends on Facebook and reposted a photo from [creator] on Grapevine's Instagram page as an example of great influencer marketing. I felt she really brought your brand aesthetic into her amazing photo. You can see yours and other great examples of influencer marketing at #GrapeFinds: https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/grapefinds/
I can see you're getting great buzz based on the number of likes. Are you happy with the increased engagement you're getting compared to the spend?
Best,
[Rep]

Hi [Rep],
Thanks for your interest in [Company]. I’m glad to see that our YouTube videos and instagram work is having a good impact! I did some research on Grapevine and would be interested to learn more about the platform. We are currently using a YouTube influencer service that I am not super happy with, so I would love to learn more about Grapevine. Can you please send through some information, case studies, minimum spend info, etc?

Hi [Prospect Name],
I was speaking with [creator] the other day and she said that she's basically lived in your [product] all winter. She's a huge fan of [Brand] She specifically loves X about [product].
I'm also a huge social media nerd and love your Instagram page. It looks like there are a number of influencers with strong followings who are sharing your products.
With this kind of success, campaign coordination via email and social channels usually becomes frustrating and time-consuming. Sometimes, it becomes almost impossible to track who you are working with, let alone the results from each campaign. How are you keeping yourself organized?
Best,
[Rep]
"
301,Sales_email_that_prove_flattery_will_get_everywhere,"
It’s such a pleasure to connect. Love that you’re hearing such great things about [Brand] and glad [product] was a hit. I’m still wearing it myself.
I love the idea of Grapevine and would love to schedule time to chat about the platform. Sounds so amazing!
"
302,Sales_email_that_prove_flattery_will_get_everywhere,"
Hi [Prospect],
Not sure if you saw my note below? Reason I'm asking whether the campaign has been successful is because I'm always looking for ways to help my clients do better campaigns. Yours looks like a good example.
Would you like to swap notes or ideas re: influencer marketing? I have 100s of examples that I can share too.
Best,
[Rep]

I haven’t heard from you in a while. Usually, when someone vanishes like this, it’s because A) they’ve gotten caught up in other projects at work, B) this isn’t a priority right now, or C) they’re no longer interested.

Everyone always eats the caramel chews first.

It was fantastic meeting you last week at the Orange Conference. I enjoyed our conversation about innovative software and building great things.
As we were discussing the software I'm working to build, you mentioned knowing Alexa over at Example Ventures and how she's an expert in this space. If you're willing, an introduction to Alexa would be greatly beneficial and she might be interested in learning more.
I understand you have a busy schedule, so I attached a short blurb below to make the introduction as easy as possible. Would you be able to take a moment to introduce me?
