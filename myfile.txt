We've all gotten gifts we wish had never been placed on this earth. But this gift I have for you? It's not one of 'em.

And if you'd rather go with Mona's sweater and get back to me after the first of the year -- that's OK too.

You:demo recap
Robo:
Hi Chandler,
Thanks for taking a look under the hood with me today. Our sustainability consulting service seems like a good fit for Hugh Apparel. Here are the main solutions we discussed:

We’ll help you go carbon-neutral, which our research shows 87% of your customers care about
We’ll put together a sustainability report highlighting areas of improvement in your environmental policies
We’ll audit your waste to find areas of cost savings

You mentioned you’ll need to discuss this with your boss, so I’m attaching the following resources: A case study from Joe Threads, another company in the online men’s retail space, and some testimonials from current customers.
The next step is discussing a timeline for getting started. Please let me know if you have any questions. If not, I’ll talk to you on Wednesday at 4:15 p.m.
Best,Monica

Hi [First Name],

Hi [First Name],
Just left a quick message at the office for you. I chuckled a little bit when I got an automated email this morning from your predecessor, [NAME OF PREDECESSOR] who we worked with briefly, and before him, [OTHER FORMER COWORKER NAME], who we worked with as well ...
First and foremost, congrats on coming into this new role! I'm sure you've got a lot going on - so this conversation might be timely or not. If you're stressed, this is my go-to.
My role here is working with businesses (in the area) on how they can effectively and efficiently drive more traffic to their website, increase conversions, and nurture leads into customers.
How has your first month kicked off so far?

You:tendency to slip
Robo:
Hi [prospect name],
Following up on my previous email, as they have a tendency to slip through the cracks. At the very least, I wanted to provide you with the top resources that your peers at other [prospect's industry] companies found helpful:

[Helpful link]
[Case study]

Would it be helpful if we scheduled 15-20 minutes to discuss how some of these topics may align with [prospect company's] strategy? Just book some time on my calendar here:

You:company published
Robo:
Hey [prospect name],
I saw the [content medium] your company published about [subject].
I was impressed by how you managed to make such complex subject matter accessible without sacrificing thoroughness. [Reference to what they do].
I have experience at [helping companies with relevant assistance]. Would you be interested in chatting for twenty minutes this week?
Thanks,
[Your name]

You:congraas
Robo:
Hey [Prospect name],
We've all gotten gifts we wish had never been placed on this earth. But this gift I have for you? It's not one of 'em.
If you buy anytime between now and December 31, I can offer you [insert discount]. As simple as that!
If you're interested in learning more, give me a call or schedule some time on my calendar.
And if you'd rather go with Mona's sweater and get back to me after the first of the year -- that's OK too.
Happy Holidays,
[Your name]
